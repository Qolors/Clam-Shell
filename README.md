# Clam Shell

Clam Shell is a self-hosted anti-virus engine for Discord servers, powered by the open-source ClamAV engine. It provides real-time scanning of files and URLs shared within your Discord server, ensuring a safe and secure environment for your community. Clam Shell also features phishing detection by referencing a list of phishing URLs, which is automatically updated every 12 hours. Additionally, it supports posting logs to a designated Discord channel for easy monitoring if desired.

## Features

- **Discord Bot Integration:** Monitors your Discord server for file and URL sharing, and queues them for scanning.
- **ClamAV Engine:** Utilizes the powerful and open-source [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) engine for virus scanning.
- **Phishing Detection:** Detects phishing URLs by referencing an up-to-date list, ensuring protection against online threats.
- **Automatic Updates:** The phishing URL list is automatically updated every 12 hours to keep your server protected against new threats.
- **Discord Logging:** Posts logs to a designated Discord channel for easy monitoring.
- **Automated Safety:** Deletes, removes, reports messages that are sending infected attachment/urls.
